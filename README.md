# Img Snippet

ImgSnippet allows users to take 'snippets' (a selected snapshot of the screen) or a standard screenshot (a snapshot of the entire visible monitor).
Screenshots and snippets are saved locally in the 'captures' folder and uploaded to imgur.com. 
When a screenshot or snippet is taken, the image can be viewed in the captures directory and the uploaded image link will be copied to the clipboard.
Users can change the bindings, capture directory, interface settings etc. in the application settings from the tray menu.


## Keybinds

Create Snippet: Ctrl + Shift + 1
Take Screenshot: Ctrl + Shift + 2

Note: key binds can be changed in settings
